1.) I chose to make the REST API in Node.js with express because the endpoints used requests and responses in a JSON format, which follows JavaScript object syntax. Node.js is also a very popular framework for creating REST APIs. It is also very efficient, concise, neater, and easier to prototype than other languages. Express, being a huge framework for Node.js, also made handling endpoints and the HTTP methods really efficient. I also used Postman to make the REST API requests, which was really convenient. 

2.) The advantages of my solution is that it takes into account consecutive spend requests. It is also a concise, 1 source-file program. The disadvantages are that I only made the scope of the project for a singular user rather than creating a database for keeping track of multiple users. 

3.) My favorite school project has been the group project I did to develop an app called "Scholarly Connections" which would connect "scholars" (colleagues) together in a graph. This was my first time ever developing as a backend in a team scenario. We had to implement Djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths between scholars too. The most challenging part about this project, however, was implementing my teammates code (placeholder functions) because it made me very confused on how to connect all the pieces together. Overall though, it was a great experience and I learned a lot from the class on how to be apart of a developer team.
